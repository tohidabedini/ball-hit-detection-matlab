# Signals and Systems course final project
Three methods are used to detect ball hit detection while some people may speak during ball hit.

* Method one is not realtime and gets a file as input.
* Method two is real-time but does not compare the frame with previous frame.
* Method three is real-time and compares the frame with previous frame.

We use frequency filters to divide ball and human signals.
